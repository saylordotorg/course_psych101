**Unit 3: The Biology of Psychology** <span id="3"></span> 
*Early psychologists considered the brain a “black box” that controlled
certain processes, though they did not know how to identify these
processes or how the brain controlled them. This is no longer the case;
nowadays, scientists insist that the psychological mind and
physiological body are fully integrated with one another. As such, in
the past few years, no subject has become more relevant to psychology
than neuroscience, or the study of the structure and function of the
brain. Today, knowledge of the biological origins of our psychological
states is integral to the study of psychology. In this unit, we will
review the basic biological and neurological structures that
psychologists associate with human thought processes and behaviors.*

     Instructions: Note that this app is only available for iOS devices.
    Once you have downloaded it, visit the “Lobes,” “Gyri,” “Sulci,” and
    “Brodmann Areas” sections to review descriptions of each component,
    brain location, and function/connectivity. While reviewing each
    component, click on the “Left Hemi,” “Right Hemi,” or “Head”
    utilities to see 3D colored sections of the area being studied and
    its relation to additional brain anatomy.  
      
     This application provides graphic 3D illustrations of major brain
    anatomy, areas, and components that influence the biological nature
    of psychology, including neural circuitry, communication, and
    connectivity (*i.e.,* how physical structures play important roles
    in the behavior of individuals).

    (Android App)  
      
     Instructions: If you choose to use this app, you will first need to
    download the version appropriate for your mobile device. With this
    app, you can experience the biological nature of psychology as it
    relates to brain anatomy and function, particularly neural
    communication and the body’s nervous systems. This application
    integrates the “mind-body” philosophy by focusing on biological and
    neural stimulation to aid sleep, healing, meditation, relaxation,
    concentration, and learning. To fully understand this application’s
    function, please read the “info” section (notepad) found at the top
    right of the application screen to familiarize yourself with
    brainwave stimulation, EEG pattern frequency, and application of
    beat tonalities.  
      
     If using the Android version, please also visit the “Sleep and
    Healing” section, which helps tune your brain frequency toward a
    drowsy state, enhancing your sleep quality and mental health; the
    “Meditation and Relaxation” section, which helps you quickly attain
    a meditative state; and/or the “Focus and Learning” section, which
    increases attention and boosts your mental speed.  
        
     If using the iOS version, please visit each of the eight preset
    wave patterns (“Headache Therapy,” “Dreamy,” “Self-hypnosis,”
    “Attention Increase,” “Creativity Enhancing,” “IQ Increase,”
    “Learning Aid,” and “White Noise”) to experience binaural beats
    specific to those neural stimuli. Please note that if you want to
    experience additional binaural beats using the iOS version, you will
    need to purchase the app to gain full access.
