**Unit 2: The Nature and Nurture of Behavior** <span id="2"></span> 
*What makes you “you”? This question gets to the heart of one of the
longest-running debates in psychology: the nurture versus nature
dispute, which asks whether humans are a product of their environment or
of their biological makeup. While it is unlikely that we will ever
conclusively answer this question, research has provided us with some
important insights that will assist you in understanding arguments on
both sides of the debate. This unit will introduce you to a number of
these concepts, identifying several of the factors that psychologists
have isolated as potential identity-shapers. We will examine the
interplay of these forces and focus in on the gene-environment
interaction.*

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   explain the nature versus nurture argument and the current status of
    thinking regarding gene-environment interaction;
-   define the field of behavioral genetics and describe how genetic
    research on behavior is conducted; and
-   describe how genes interact with the environment to influence
    intelligence and a variety of mental disorders.

     Instructions: Chapters from this online text will be assigned
    throughout this unit. You may choose to download this document now,

     These chapters will illustrate scholarly research with applicable
    examples. As you progress through the subunits listed below, test
    yourself on what you have retained. Remember: The process of
    reflection is important to “creating a memory” of the material you
    have learned; it will increase the probability that you ultimately
    retain the information. Ask yourself the following questions to both
    test your knowledge and help you retain the information presented:  
      
     a) What are the main takeaway points of this subunit? For example,
    what do I know about the gene-environment interaction? You are
    testing whether you can list several important points that address
    this question.  
      
     b) What are the main terms associated with the concepts in this
    chapter? In attempting to answer this question, you are testing
    yourself on whether you can speak about this topic in an articulate
    way such that you can sufficiently communicate the main ideas of the
    chapter. In other words, you are asking yourself if you understand
    the language and concepts associated with the topic of learning.  
      
     If you notice that it is difficult to answer these
    questions – don’t worry! Try rereading the text while paying special
    attention to the information that you think helps answer the
    questions listed above. After rereading the text, test yourself
    again to see if your comprehension and retention have improved.  
      
     *Note on the Text: This text is geared toward introducing you to
    behavioral genetics, which is a separate (albeit related) field
    often associated with the idea of “nature versus nurture.” This is
    an interdisciplinary field that is influenced by psychology and
    several other fields. We chose this book as it sufficiently
    represents and highlights both the environmental and genetic
    influences that affect individual differences in traits. The
    examples used throughout this text are particularly useful in
    highlighting the real-world implications of the scholarly knowledge
    presented.*
