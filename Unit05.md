**Unit 5: Learning and Memory** <span id="5"></span> 
*Psychologists are concerned with how people learn and create memories
of their experiences. For example, early psychologists such as Ivan
Pavlov and B. F. Skinner performed experiments that explained human
action by measuring changes in behavior. These experiments informed our
understanding of the process of learning and marked the beginning of the
field of behaviorism. In addition, the subfields of cognitive psychology
and neuropsychology have endeavored to determine how people think,
perceive, remember, and learn. In this chapter, we will draw from
behaviorism, cognitive psychology, and neuropsychology to learn the
basic principles of learning and memory.*
