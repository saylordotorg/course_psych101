**Unit 4: Sensation, Perception, and Consciousness** <span
id="4"></span> 
*As human beings, we perceive our world through our senses. This means
that we are constantly performing a complex set of processes by which we
take in sensory information, convert it into a form usable by the brain,
and have the brain send signals to a relevant part of the body in order
to tell it how to respond – all in a matter of milliseconds. In this
unit, we will highlight two sensory systems and gain a deeper
understanding of how we perceive the world around us. We will also
discuss how our perceptions of the world and our self are influenced by
our different states of consciousness. What happens when we are asleep?
What is the function of our dreams? We will also learn how our
biological rhythms function and how they can be used to explain
phenomena like jetlag. Finally, the unit concludes with a discussion
related to psychoactive drugs and how these drugs play a role in our
state of consciousness.*

**Unit4 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:
-   describe why sensation and perception are major interest areas in
    the field of psychology;
-   identify the areas of the brain required to perceive external
