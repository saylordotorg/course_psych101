**Unit 6: Development** <span id="6"></span> 
*The physical, mental, and emotional changes that an individual
undergoes over the course of his or her lifetime raise a number of
questions about who we are and how we develop as human beings. One such
question is whether our traits are stable or changeable throughout our
lifetime; another is whether development is a continuous, gradual
process or a set of discrete stages. Though these questions remain
unresolved, this unit will provide you with ways to think critically
about these issues. It will also provide you with an overview of human
development, from infancy to old age.*

    App)  
      
     Instructions: If you choose to use this app, you will first need to
    download it to your mobile device. Note that it is only available on
    iOS devices. Once downloaded, open the app to learn about and apply
    the 16 personality types. This application uses Dr. Carl Jung’s
    assertion that the eight cognitive processes people use (*i.e.,*
    Extroverted vs. Introverted, Sensing, Intuiting, Thinking, and
    Feeling) combine to match 16 personality types. The 16 personality
    types are then differentiated on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator
    (*i.e.,* Extroverted vs. Introverted, Sensing vs. Intuiting,
    Thinking vs. Feeling, Judging vs. Perceiving) showing the cluster of
    cognitive processes a particular individual uses (*e.g.,* INFJ-
    Introverting, Intuiting, Feeling, and Judging). Determining a
    personality type can help you understand how a person thinks and
    feels and how they relate with others. It also demonstrates how
    personality is innate as well as how it is influenced by external
    factors over the lifespan.  
      
     Then, after exploring these personality types, please visit the
    “Assess” utility and take the personality quiz. It is recommended
    that you use the “Long-Form” assessment as this will be most
    accurate in determining your personality type. After you’ve
    completed the assessment, review your personality type result and
    visit the “Types” grid to compare your specific personality type
    with one of the other 15 types. You may also ask a friend or family
    member to take an assessment and then compare your personality
    types. For additional information on personality typing, please
    visit the “About” utility and review the resources provided.
