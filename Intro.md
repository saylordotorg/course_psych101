Course Syllabus for "PSYCH101-EXC: Introduction to Psychology"
--------------------------------------------------------------

This course will introduce you to the fundamental principles of
psychology and to the major subjects of psychological inquiry. It has
been designed to not only provide you with the tools necessary for the
study of psychology but to present you with a sampling of the major
areas of psychology research. The course begins with a short overview of
how psychology developed as an academic discipline and an introduction
to a number of the principle methodologies most commonly deployed in its
study. The subsequent units are arranged around broad areas of research,
including emotion, development, memory, and psychopathology. We will
focus on well-substantiated research and current trends within each of
these categories. This course is designed to align with Excelsior
College’s UExcel Psychology examination. Visit the [Excelsior
website](http://www.excelsior.edu/exams/introduction-to-psychology) to download
the content guide for the PSYX-101 exam.  For more information about

**Optional Resources:** To provide you with additional information and
concept reinforcement, some subunits offer the option of purchasing an
app. These are optional resources, as there are costs associated with
them. Please note that no quiz or exam questions will be derived from
the content in these apps. The content they provide is intended to
supplement the understanding you gain from completing the primary
resources. Note that the time advisories provided throughout this course
do not include the time you may spend on the optional resources.  
    
 **Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials.
Pay special attention to Units 2 and 3, as these may be particularly
challenging to students who do not have a background in biology. Units
6, 7, and 8 are theory-based and will provide the foundation for our
more advanced psychology courses. You will also need to complete
assessments for Units 3, 4, and 5, along with the final exam.  
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on your final exam.
However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
complete all readings, lectures, and quizzes.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam. Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it. If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.

 **Time Commitment:** Completing this course should take you a total of
**96.75 hours**. Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists the
amount of time you should expect to spend on each subunit. These should
help you plan your time accordingly. It may be useful to take a look at
these time advisories and determine how much time you have over the next
few weeks to complete each unit and then set goals for yourself. For
example, Unit 1 should take you approximately 9 hours to complete.
Perhaps you can check your calendar and decide to complete subunits 1.1
and 1.2.1 (a total of 3 hours) on a Monday, subunit 1.2.2 (3 hours) on a
Tuesday, subunit 1.2.3 (3 hours) on a Wednesday, and so forth for the
other units.
