**Unit 1: The History and Methods of Psychology** <span id="1"></span> 
*“Psychology has a long past but a short history.” This brief statement
by one of the pioneers of psychological research, Herman Ebbinghaus,
captures the history of psychology as a discipline. Though it is
relatively new as a formal academic subject, the questions it seeks to
answer have been around since the beginning of man. In this unit, we
will review the history of psychology as a discipline, by learning about
both its ancient philosophical (“prescientific”) roots and its more
recent reincarnation as a “scientific” field of study.*
