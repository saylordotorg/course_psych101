**Unit 7: Social Psychology** <span id="7"></span> 
*Human beings are social beings. As psychologists, we acknowledge this
fact by studying the ways in which an individual’s social environment
impacts his or her emotional and mental functioning. This is called
social psychology – the focus of this unit. We will discuss the social
behavior of individuals, groups, and entire societies as well as the
influences that our relationships to these entities have on us as
individuals. The readings conclude with a discussion of the theories
related to human motivation and emotion.*
