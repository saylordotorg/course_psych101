**Unit 8: Psychopathology** <span id="8"></span> 
*Today, we commonly think of psychology as a means of treating mental
disorders. However, the branch of psychology that addresses these
disorders is known as psychopathology, a field of study made famous by
Sigmund Freud. Clinical psychologists have since refined the field,
developing more sophisticated methods for diagnosis and treatment so
that clients can maintain a normal lifestyle. In this unit, we will aim
at understanding different perspectives on psychological disorders,
learning to identify characteristic symptoms of each.*
